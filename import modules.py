#importing python is the process of loading code from python module to current script#
# import math
# from math import sqrt, pi#we can directly import specific variables or function from modules#
# from math import sqrt as s#similarly it is a shortcut to call sqrt as s#
# import math as m#it is a shortcut to call math function"import math as m"
import  sample#so what happened here is we imported file from other place using import filename#
print(sample.welcome)
# mat=math.floor(22.345)
# result=math.sqrt(3.8)
# print(s(9));
# print(m.sqrt(987))
# print(dir(m))
# print(type(m.ulp))
# print(sqrt(3.9));#when we import sqrt from math module u don't have to use math.sqrt u can simply write sqrt(3.145)#
# print(mat)
# print(result)
